To implement the API endpoints for the out-patient appointment system, you would typically use a web framework like Django or Flask for Python, or Express for Node.js. Below, I'll provide a basic outline of how you can structure the API.
1.Doctors Listing:
  Endpoint: /api/doctors
  Method: GET
  Description: This endpoint will retrieve a list of doctors.
  Response Format:[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Dr. John Doe",
    "specialty": "Cardiologist",
    "available_slots": [
      {
        "day": "Monday",
        "time": "18:00 - 20:00",
        "max_patients": 5,
        "available_patients": 3
      },
      // Additional slots for the week
    ]
  },
  // Additional doctors
]
2.Doctor Detail Page:
  Endpoint: /api/doctors/<doctor_id>
  Method: GET
  Description: This endpoint will provide detailed information about a specific doctor.
  Response Format:{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Dr. John Doe",
  "specialty": "Cardiologist",
  "available_slots": [
    {
      "day": "Monday",
      "time": "18:00 - 20:00",
      "max_patients": 5,
      "available_patients": 3
    },
    // Additional slots for the week
  ]
}
3.Appointment Booking:
  Endpoint: /api/book-appointment
  Method: POST
  Description: This endpoint will allow patients to book an appointment with a doctor.
  Request Format:{
  "doctor_id": 1,
  "day": "Monday",
  "time": "18:00 - 19:00"
}
  Response Format:{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Appointment booked successfully!",
  "appointment_details": {
    "id": 123,
    "doctor_id": 1,
    "doctor_name": "Dr. John Doe",
    "patient_name": "Jane Doe",
    "day": "Monday",
    "time": "18:00 - 19:00"
  }
}
